# Flask Learning Adventure 🚀

This repository is basically my digital playground where I'm exploring the world of Flask. 

## What's This All About? 🤔

This is an educational project where I'm diving deep into Flask's functionality. Think of it as my personal Flask laboratory where I'm mixing different features and seeing what happens. 

## Features (So Far) ✨

- Template inheritance (because copying and pasting HTML is so 1999)
- A base template
- Some basic routes
- A navigation bar 

## Why Would Anyone Use This? 🤷‍♂️

Honestly? Probably no one should. This is my learning playground, and while the code works, it's not exactly production-ready. And will never be

## How to Run This Thing 🏃‍♂️

1. Clone this repo (if you really want to)
2. Set up a virtual environment (because we're not savages)
3. Install the requirements (there's probably a requirements.txt somewhere)
4. Run `flask run`
5. Open your browser and pray it works

## Contributing 🤝

While I'm not actively looking for contributions (this is a learning project, remember?), if you find something that could be improved, feel free to:
- Open an issue
- Submit a pull request
- Or just laugh at my code and move on

## License 📝

This project is licensed under the "Do Whatever You Want With It" license. Seriously, it's just a learning project. 

P.S. If you actually use this in production, please let me know. I'll be both flattered and concerned. 😅
